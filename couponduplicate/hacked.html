                    We’ve outlined a few different types of phishing attacks to watch out for:

                    <h5 class="form-check-label">
                        1. The phishing mail pretends to be originating from one of the Company Founders or a higher
                        authority and could need urgent attention. The phishing messages tell the victims that one of
                        vendor payments is pending and needs to be done on priority basis. While going through the
                        email, the victim will not think about any fraudulent activity as the email looks genuine as it
                        is in a day to day email format.
